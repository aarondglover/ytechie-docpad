If you're interested in hearing about writing practical unit tests in .NET, I'll be speaking at the [Fox Valley .NET user group](http://fvnug.org) ["Day of .NET" event](http://fvnug.org/dnn/DayOfNet/Schedule/tabid/62/Default.aspx) May 9th! Here is the synopsis for your reading pleasure:

  > Want to learn how to write good automated unit tests that are beneficial both to the product/customer and to you as a developer? See an overview of the mechanics of unit testing including the tools and frameworks available. You'll see examples of how to test existing code, but you'll also see practical examples of how seemingly un-testable code can be designed so that it can be tested with ease. Learn how test driven development and refactoring will improve the readability of your code, minimize debugging, and speed up development.

If you're anywhere near the Northeast Wisconsin area, stop in. It's free!

I'll be publishing both the presentation and a supporting 25+ page paper shortly, so make sure you're [subscribed to my feed](http://feedproxy.google.com/Ytechie).
