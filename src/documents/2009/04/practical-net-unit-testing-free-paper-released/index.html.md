title: Practical .NET Unit Testing â€“ Free paper released
date: 2009-04-30
---

I've been working on a unit testing paper that sums up my experience in unit testing, and discusses some of the core information that I feel is important about the subject. It's very much a work in progress, but I wanted to get it out sooner rather than later. I'll be continuously updating it as time goes on.

**Update: I updated the [PDF location](http://downloads.ytechie.com/Practical_.NET_Unit_Testing.pdf) to one that doesn't require registration.**

There are some really great books out there about unit testing, but I think some of them are trying too hard to be long enough to be considered a "book". I set out to create a document that fills the gap between the various snippets of information from blog posts, and the comprehensive books on the subject. If you're interested in something a bit more in-depth, here are some great books on the subject:

* [The Art of Unit Testing by Roy Osherove](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933988274?ie=UTF8&tag=ytechie-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=1933988274)
* [xUnit Test Patterns by Gerard Meszaros](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0131495054?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ytechie-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0131495054)  

The paper currently consists of 5 main sections:

* Why Write Unit Tests?
* Unit Test Mechanics
* Common Unit Testing Strategies
* Designing for Testability
* Advanced Techniques  

Here is a more complete snapshot of the current outline:

* Introduction
* Unit Testing & Managers
* What Unit Tests Really Do

* Testing Framework
* Test Runner
* Unit Test Structure
