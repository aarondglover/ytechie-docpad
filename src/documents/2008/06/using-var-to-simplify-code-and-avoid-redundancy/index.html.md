title: Using "var" to simplify code and avoid redundancy

You've probably already heard of the new &quot;var&quot; keyword that you can use to declare variables in your .NET code. I wanted to clear up some quick myths and give a quick overview of when it's most valuable.

If you haven't heard of it, you can now use this syntax:

	var c = new Cat();

Instead of this:

	Cat c = new Cat();

As Jeff Atwood mentioned, it's a [great way to avoid redundancy](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001136.html). It's obvious that you're creating a "Cat" object, why do you have to say it twice?

The most important thing to realize, is that it's NOT a var like in JavaScript or other languages ([DIM in VB](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/BackToBasicsVarDim.aspx)). It really is 100% a "Cat" object, complete with intellisense. The generated IL would be no different than specifying the type when you declare it. **It's simply a compiler trick**.

Another important thing to remember is that you the assignment must be combined with the declaration. If that wasn't the case, readability would be very poor.

	var myName = "Jason"; //Allowed
	var yourName; //Not allowed
	yourName = "Bob"; //Glad you can't do this

What are some really good examples of when it ideally should be used:

	List<Dictionary<int, string>> customers = new List<Dictionary<int, string>>(); //Yuck!
	var customers = new List<Dictionary<int, string>>(); //Yay!

	OrderRepository orderRepo = (OrderRepository)ctx.GetObject("orderRepository"); //Yuck!
	var orderRepo = (OrderRepository)ctx.GetObject("orderRepository"); //Yay!

	string name = "Jason Young"; //Kinda yucky
	var name = "Jason Young"; //Kinda better

As you can see, those examples have obvious redundancy. Using the "var" keyword increases readability, and makes it easier to change if needed.

There are certainly times when its use is questionable. In the following example, I'm calling a function that returns some data. Since I'm not explicitly defining the type that is being returned from that function, I have to do some digging to figure out the type being returned. In this case, you'll have to define the correct way to handle it in your coding standards.

	var data = GetData();

Another potential readability issue comes up in the following case. You might not want to use the "Circle" specific methods (Circle inherits from Shape).

	Shape s = GetCircle(); //I see what you're doing
	var s = GetCircle(); //Do you want a shape, or a circle?

Aside from a couple of decisions that need to be made in your organization, I think this is a great addition, and should make our lives as developers a little bit easier. It's just another tool for our tool belt. With great power comes great responsibility
