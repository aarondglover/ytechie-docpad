title: Consolidating - Subversion virtual machine moved

[As I mentioned before](http://www.ytechie.com/2008/05/focus-is-the-key-to-success/), I'm trying to consolidate the number of websites that I have to maintain. My young-technologies.com domain was badly out of date, and didn't really have any useful information. I decided to redirect all of it's pages to this site.

![Moving Boxes](moving-boxes.jpg)

The only page that was getting real traffic on that site was the [Subversion virtual machine appliance](http://www.ytechie.com/svn-vm/), which I created a long time ago. I decided to move that page to this domain. That means that I have only one page to manage instead of an entire domain.

If you haven't seen that virtual appliance, [it's worth checking out](http://www.ytechie.com/svn-vm/). It's basically a fully functional Subversion install on [Ubuntu linux](http://www.ubuntu.com/), with [WebSVN](http://websvn.tigris.org/) installed to view it in a web browser. It's been downloaded over a thousand times, and it's now being hosted using [Amazon's S3 service](http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=16427261).

While the appliance has [found a new home](http://www.ytechie.com/svn-vm/), I'm not sure if an when it's going to be updated. If there are any future announcements about it, they'll be made on this blog.
