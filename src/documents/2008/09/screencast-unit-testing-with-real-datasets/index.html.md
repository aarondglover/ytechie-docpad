title: Screencast - Unit testing with real DataSets

[As I've mentioned before](http://www.ytechie.com/2008/04/net-xml-dataset-generator-from-a-sql-query/), I [wrote a small utility](http://code.google.com/p/queryxmldataset/) for running a SQL query, and returning the results as an XML serilialized DataSet.

I created a quick screencast to demonstrate how you go about using this utility. I'm new to screencasts, so don't expect a high production value!
