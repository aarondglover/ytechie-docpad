title: What do you do with your old hardware?

I've been on a mission to scale down all of the old tech hardware I have laying around in my house. Here is a partial list of what I had/have:

3 working mid-grade desktop computers, 3 Netgear routers, 17&quot; CRT Monitor, Vonage VOIP adapter, Sunrocket VOIP SIP adapter, Subwoofer, 10 network cards, Modems, PCI + AGP video cards, 802.11g PCMCIA card, 5 hard drives ranging from 20gb to 160gb, 3 256MB USB flash drives, 3 memory cards, Old computer books, 2 UPS's

So here is my question. **What do you do with stuff like this?**

**In round 1,** I threw away anything I knew was completely worthless. Frayed wires, parallel to TI-86 cables, those useless USB to PS/2 mouse adapters.

**In round 2**, I sold some of the small, valuable items on [eBay](http://www.ebay.com). This is a great place to sell anything of value. You'll have a large audience, and you'll get what it's worth. You'll also have to deal with packing and shipping it.

**In round 3**, I gathered up almost all of the rest, and sold it on [Craigslist](http://craigslist.org/). Which, by the way, is a great way to get rid of a lot of stuff very quickly. I took a picture of a whole pile, described some of the more valuable items, and sold it in a couple of days.

**In round 4**, I'm not sure what to do! I have lots of small things left like the USB flash drives, case fans, hard drives, etc. Back to Craigslist?

What is the best way to get rid of this stuff without filling up the landfills? I know there is someone out there that is about to drop $20 on a network card, when I have 10 here that he could have for free. I just don't want to spend the time and money to pack it up and ship it somewhere.

Some suggestions I've received:

*   Donate to schools - I'm not sure if or what they're interested in. I'll have to contact them.
*   Donate to Goodwill - I called them and they don't want it!  

**Any thoughts? This is surely a common problem amongst techies?**
