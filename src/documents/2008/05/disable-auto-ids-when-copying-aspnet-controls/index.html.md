title: Disable auto id's when copying ASP.NET controls
date: 2008-05-02

Don't you hate it when you copy an ASP.NET server control without an ID, only to have it add one when you paste it?

For example, look at this code:

	<asp:RequiredFieldValidator runat="server" />
	<asp:RequiredFieldValidator ID="RequiredFieldValidator1" runat="server" /></pre>

I took the first line, copied it and pasted it, and got the second line. It's rare that I need to reference a validator in my CodeBehind.

Here is the option to disable this functionality in the Visual Studio options (Tools->Options):

Simply uncheck the "Auto ID elements on paste in Source view" option.
