title: SimpleTracking.com UPS Update

As you know, [SimpleTracking.com](http://www.SimpleTracking.com) supports FedEx, DHL, and USPS. We've been trying to get back UPS support for well over a year.

Thank you all for the incredible support for trying to get UPS to let us use their tracking data the way YOU want. The response to [our petition](http://www.petitiononline.com/st0001/petition.html) has been incredible, getting over 400 signatures in a few short months.

I've been <strike>working</strike> pleading with UPS to see this as an incredible opportunity for everyone. The only reason that we don't have UPS support is because of the terms of service that their lawyers have written. They're understandably very leery of making an exception to that rule.

I'm trying to make them understand that we're receiving over 15,000 unique visitors every month. The masses have spoken. You want to track packages YOUR way.

I know it's just a matter of talking to the right person in UPS. If any of you know who that person is, or have a contact of UPS that may be of use, please let me know. Email me at: jason at young-technologies.com, or leave a comment.

I'll post updates as they arrive.
